The Lord is watching over His kingdom. He is inspiring its leadership to care for its ever-growing membership.
"Imagine the consoling, liberating, exalting feeling that will come to you when you see the reality of the Atonement and the practical, everyday value of it to you individually."
"The redeeming presence of our loving Father-God in the universe is the … supernal truth which, along with His plan of happiness, reigns preeminent and imperial over all other realities."
Tell your children that you love them and that you are so happy to have them in your family. Prepare yourselves spiritually to receive the guidance through the Holy Ghost.
[Your] most important stewardship is the glorious responsibility your Father in Heaven has given you to watch over and care for your own soul.
Maintaining our spiritual strength is … a daily challenge. The greatest source of that spiritual strength comes … from our temples.
The burden [of a bishop] is a heavy one that cannot be fulfilled without the supportive efforts of ward officers and members.
"We may know that the warning is from the Lord [when] the law of witnesses, authorized witnesses, has been invoked. When the words of prophets seem repetitive, that should rivet our attention."
Every member must come to know the sacred nature of his or her own service in the Church.
"For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, honesty is the only policy."
"Just as Jesus’ anxious Apostles were given peace by “another Comforter,” so today can all men and women receive the same marvelous blessing each day of their lives."
"I express gratitude and love for Jesus Christ and His Atonement, for His willingness to leave the realms of the heavens as a God and come to earth as a lowly babe."
"If you try your best to be the best parent you can be, you will have done all that a human being can do and all that God expects you to do."
Learn to be … obedient above all things—that you might be able to carry out the Lord’s work in the majestic way in which it must be done.
"Ordinary men, blessed with the privilege of holding the priesthood of God, may be called upon to do extraordinary tasks and accomplish mighty feats through faith in that sacred power!"
"Caring for others is the very essence of priesthood responsibility. It is the power to bless, to heal, and to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel."

Every convert is precious. Every convert is a son or daughter of God. Every convert is a great and serious responsibility.
"Jesus Christ, Savior of the world … was and is the ultimate pioneer, for He has gone before, showing all others the way to follow."
The Redeemer loves you and will help you do the essential things that bring happiness now and forever.
No matter how difficult the trail … we can take comfort in knowing that others before us have borne life’s most grievous trials and tragedies by looking to heaven.
"With so great an inheritance, we can do no less than our very best. Those who have gone before expect this of us. We have a mandate from the Lord."
The Holy Ghost will be our constant companion if we submit ourselves to the will of our Father in Heaven.
[The] responsibility to endure is uniquely yours. But you are never alone. I testify that the lifting power of the Lord can be yours.
The time is past when we can merely believe in this gospel; we must be passionate in our belief and in our commitment to Jesus Christ and His plan.
"[Can we] set aside our love of substance and hear the cry of the hungry, the needy, the naked, and the sick?"

"Our goal, our journey’s end, our Zion is life in the presence of our Heavenly Father. And to get there we are expected to walk and walk and walk."
We must have faith to walk away from those things that would tear us down or hold us back. … We must have faith in every footstep.
"My young sisters, we really don’t know how much good we can do until we put forth the effort."
God is our Father who watches over His kingdom. Jesus is the Christ whose name this Church bears. He stands at its head.
It is not in the proper spirit for us to decide where we will serve or where we will not. We serve where we are called.
"There is a loving Father in Heaven, and His Son, Jesus Christ; there is an adversary, Satan; through agency, all of us choose our own course; the temptations of the devil can always be overcome."
"In building the kingdom of God, every positive act, every friendly greeting, every warm smile, every thoughtful, kind note contributes to the strength of the whole."
"By strengthening each other spiritually, building faith and fellowship, we wear the shoes of pioneers."

"In … Church meetings around the world, we come together seeking companionship—the good company of brothers and sisters in the gospel and the comfort of sweet communion with the Spirit of God."
How seriously have you personally taken the Lord’s charge to share His gospel? It is a lifelong responsibility … to be addressed differently according to the various seasons of your life.
Standing for truth and right is not solely a Sunday thing. Every day our neighborhoods and communities are in desperate need of our support and our commitment to safety and law and order.
"Our vision of you and your work looks beyond the outward appearance of a boy and sees instead a bearer of the holy priesthood outfitted with its attendant powers, duties, and blessings."
We belong to the greatest cause on earth. We are the pioneers of the future. Let us go forth like the armies of Helaman and build the kingdom of God.
Can we … reach out to those for whom we are responsible and bring them to the table of the Lord to feast on His word and to enjoy the companionship of His Spirit?
"May you look upon the Church as your great and good friend, your refuge when the world appears to be closing around you, your hope when things are dark, your pillar of fire."

To the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
"Loving God and loving our neighbors is the doctrinal foundation of ministering; home-centered, Church-supported learning; Sabbath-day spiritual worship; and the work of salvation."
We should learn to discern the truth not only through our rational minds but also through the very still and small voice of the Spirit.

"Because of God’s plan and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be cleansed by the process of repentance."
"Just as reading and learning about muscles is not enough to build muscle, reading and learning about faith without adding action is insufficient to build faith."
Jesus Christ calls us in His voice and His name. He seeks and gathers us. He teaches us how to minister in love.
Blessings will come as we strive to fulfill our individual responsibility to learn and love the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
"Even while we are patiently waiting upon the Lord, there are certain blessings that come to us immediately."
"When we live the gospel of Jesus Christ, when we draw upon the Savior’s Atonement and press forward with faith, we are fortified against the adversary."

Keep your eyes and your hearts centered on the Savior Jesus Christ and the eternal joy that comes only through Him.

In the Church the authority of the priesthood is exercised under the direction of a priesthood leader who holds the keys of that priesthood.
Let us put our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ into action!
The prophecies that have been fulfilled by the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ are many.
Look and pray for opportunities to let your light shine that others may see the way to Jesus Christ.
"Because the Restoration reaffirmed the foundational truth that God does work in this world, we can hope, we should hope, even when facing the most insurmountable odds."
The covenants received and the ordinances performed in temples are essential to the sanctifying of our hearts and for the ultimate exaltation of God’s sons and daughters.

Today I expand my call for prayer to all people from every country around the world.

"When we exercise patience, our faith increases. As our faith increases, so does our joy."
"Times of affliction and disappointment do not change the watchful eye of the Lord as He favorably looks upon us, blessing us."
An important part of Heavenly Father’s plan is the opportunity to communicate with Him anytime we want.

Only faith and the word of God that fill our inner soul are sufficient to sustain us—and to allow us to access His power.
"Faith means trusting God in good times and bad, even if that includes some suffering until we see His arm revealed in our behalf."

Welcome to general conference and to the privilege of hearing the voice of the Lord.
God is among us—and is personally involved in our lives and actively guiding His children.

Jesus Christ both understands unfairness and has the power to provide a remedy.

"God has sent us right here, right now, at this momentous time in history."
"The purpose for our receiving the priesthood is to allow us to bless people for the Lord, doing so in His name."
